Carrier is a self-hosted e-mail service which can generate 'masked' addresses.
When mail is sent to a masked address, itâ€™s forwarded to your actual address.
When you notice spam coming from a masked address, just block it!

## Installation
Since this is a mail server/client and uses an external database, installation does require configuration.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/stevesoltys/carrier/wiki) for more information.

## Configuration
By default, Carrier will look for a JSON configuration file in your home directory: ```$HOME/.config/carrier/config.json```.

An example configuration file can be seen below:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "localhost": "server.mydomain.com",
        "force_tls": true
    },

    "client": {
        "dkim": true,
        "dkim_selector": "mail",
        "dkim_private_key": "/home/tomcat7/.config/carrier/dkim.der",

        "domain": "mydomain.com",
        "keystore": "/home/tomcat7/.config/carrier/keystore",
        "keystore_password": "1234567"
    },

    "accounts": [
        { "username": "username", "password": "password" }
    ]
}
```
