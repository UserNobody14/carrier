# Carrier
[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/stevesoltys/carrier.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stevesoltys/carrier.svg?branch=master)

Carrier is a self-hosted e-mail service which can generate 'masked' addresses.
When mail is sent to a masked address, itâ€™s forwarded to your actual address.
When you notice spam coming from a masked address, just block it!

## Installation
Since this is a mail server/client and uses an external database, installation does require configuration.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/stevesoltys/carrier/wiki) for more information.

## Configuration
By default, Carrier will look for a JSON configuration file in your home directory: 
```$HOME/.config/carrier/config.json```.

Check out [this page](https://github.com/stevesoltys/carrier/wiki/Configuration) for more information.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `gradle build` to install dependencies and build the project. You can run `gradle war` 
to build a WAR file for deployment.
